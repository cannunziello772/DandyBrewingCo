                The Dandy Brewing Company is Calgary's original small brewery. Although it has grown a little,
                it's still
                small at heart. We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in small batches. Our unique
                approach to brewing and keen eye to detail and fostersc reativity in both our recipes and beer
                styles. On site,
                we are pleased to offer a unique brewery experience, featuring a full service tasting room with an
                exquisite menu of

            <h2 class="article-num">01</h2>
            <h2 class="article-h2">Story</h2>
            <h2>Chef. Chemist. Teacher. Business.</h2>
            <p>The story goes back. Two high-school classmates begin a business, they graduated and went their separate
                ways.
                They cross paths again years later to discuss an interest, and a passion. </p>

            <p>In the fall of 2013, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission made sweeping changes to the brewing
                industry in Alberta,
                allowing small craft breweries to exist. It came at a perfect time. For years Ben Leon, a teacher, and
                Dylan Nosal, a chef, had been
                growing their home-brew experience, not only in size but also in knowledge. Over the course of a few
                years of practice, learning,
                and many batches, they began brewing exceptional beers on a home-built 1BBL brewhouse.</p>

            <p>While honing skills, the two were developing a keen taste for the growing selection of Craft beer
                flooding into Alberta. Much of
                their guidance came from Matt Gaetz, a veteran of the liquor business in Alberta, and a close friend.
                Between the three of them,
                the topic of starting something amazing often came up over beers and brewing. They knew they wanted it,
                they just weren't sure
                it was possible under old laws. Changes in law meant it was possible. </p>

            <p>Discussion after discussion, batch after batch, ideas developed into plans. What it always boiled down to
                was that the brewery
                would have to be exciting, forward thinking, and outside the traditional thought box for breweries in
                the province. Exciting beer
                styles, quality ingredients, and attention to every detail of production. </p>

            <p>Cue the return of Derek Waghray, a high-school friend studying chemistry on the West coast. On his return
                to Calgary, and with
                a new found interest in brewing and craft beer, he got in touch with an old high school friend. A home
                brew batch later, and a
                discussion of wild dreams, he was added to the group. He was a much needed addition bringing expertise
                in laboratory process
                and a deep understanding of the science behind the beer.</p>

            <p>When the laws were officially changed in December 2013, the four Dandies moved quickly to hammer out the
                final details for The
                Dandy Brewing Company.</p>

            <p>In January 2014 the Dandy Brewing Company was incorporated. April 2014 the lease was signed. June 2014
                the brewhouse was
                built. August 2014 the brewing began. September 2014 the beer hit the shelves. April 2015 the first
                draught accounts started
                pouring. November 2015 the Tap Room opened. January 2016 a three-fold expansion of capacity was
                completed.</p>

            <p>April 2018 saw the opening of the The Dandy Brewing Company and Tasting Room, a new production facility
                and full service
                tasting room located in the heart of Ramsay, Calgary. Fine Dining drinking food. Dandy beers. Cocktails.
                wine. The full Dandy
                experience.</p>

            <h2 class="article-h2">BEERS</h2>
            <h3>5.5% ABV The main Dandy</h3>
            <p>
                This beer is our most popular offering and available everywhere, all the time. A light body with notes
                of coffee, chocolate,
                and light roast, this traditional Oyster Stout is sure to be a favourite. Pairs well with oysters, fish,
                and other salty snacks.
            </p>
            <h3>7.3% ABV THE DANDY WILD SOUR ALE</h3>
            <p>A bold, malty sour ale soured with lacto-bacillus and fermented with a wild yeast strain. An upfront
                sourness is balanced with notes of
                green mango, Sauvignon Blanc, and pineapple.
            </p>
            <h3>7.5% ABV T2G-IPA</h3>
            <p>A bold IPA that is all sorts of Dandy. Choosing not to take sides, this rich IPA has a present bitterness
                balanced with a juicy
                citrus aroma.
            </p>
            <h3>5% ABV DANDY LAGER</h3>
            <p>
                An import style premium lager brewed with toasted rice and the finest Alberta malt. Thoughtfully hopped
                with prime German hops, for a
                subtle citrus aroma, this beer is crisp and fresh. Premium in name, Dandy in Nature.
            </p>
            <h2>upcoming</h2>
            <p>Four exciting beers a year with wide release! Look for them when the weather begins to turn.
            </p>

            <h3>BALTUS VAN TASSEL: CHERRY SOUR, 7% ABV FALL</h3>
            <p>An American Style Cherry Sour. A rich brown American Brown sour brewed with Sweet and Tart cherries for
                the perfect accompaniment to
                shorter days and colder weather.
            </p>
            <h3>IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER: BLACK IPA, 6.5% ABV WINTER</h3>
            <p> A fruity Black IPA. With only a kiss of roast, this black IPA is fresh and juicy but dark as the coldest
                days of winter. Citra and
                Mosaic are late hop additions to avoid the biterness and focus on aroma.
            </p>
            <h3>THE JUNGLE BIRD: TROPICAL DARK SOUR, 5% ABV SPRING</h3>
            <p>An homage to the classic Tiki cocktail. This beer has notes of demerara sugar, bitter lime, tropical
                pineapple coming together for a
                refreshing sour that is like no other.
            </p>
            <h3>BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS: HOPPED WHEAT ALE, 5.5% ABV SUMMER</h3>
            <p>English Summer Ale. A style developed during a late 70’s heat wave in England, this beer is designed to
                refresh in the hot summer sun.
                Dry, with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with a touch of biterness and
                a sweet citrus aroma. Patios, BBQ’s, and friends all pair perfectly with this beer!
